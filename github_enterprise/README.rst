.. _GitHub Enterprise Library: 
-----------------
GitHub Enterprise
-----------------

This library is unique in that rather than provide functional step 
implementations, it provides methods that help with the business logic
defined within pipeline templates. 

.. note:: 
  
    It also provides additional functionality that can be useful for library
    developers to get scm metadata or interact with a remote github repository.

=============
Configuration
=============

.. code:: groovy 

    libraries{
      github_enterprise
    }

================================
Pipeline Template Business Logic 
================================

The GitHub Enterprise library contributes some helper methods to help with 
pipeline template orchestration.  You can achieve fine grained control over 
what happens when in response to different GitHub events such as commits, 
pull requests, and merges. 

.. csv-table:: GitHub Flow Helper Methods 
   :header: "Method", "Build Cause" 

   "on_commit", "A direct commit to a branch" 
   "on_pull_request", "A pull request was created or a developer pushed a commit to the source branch"
   "on_change", "A combination of ``on_commit`` and ``on_pull_request``" 
   "on_merge", "A pull request was merged into the branch." 

These methods take named parameters ``to`` and ``from`` indicating direction of the github
whose value is a regular expression to compare the branch names against.

SDP provides some default keywords for branch name regular expressions:

.. csv-table:: Default Branch Regular Expressions
   :header: "Keyword", "Regular Expression" 

   "master", "/^[Mm]aster$/"
   "develop", "/^[Dd]evelop(ment|er|)$/"
   "hotfix", "/^[Hh]ot[Ff]ix-/"
   "release", "/^[Rr]elease-(\d+.)*\d$/"

.. note:: 

    These branch name regular expressions are not a part of the GitHub Enterprise
    library but rather leveraged by defining :ref:`Keywords<Keywords>` in the SDP configuration file

==========================
Example Pipeline Templates
==========================

**Full example using keywords** 

.. code:: groovy 

    on_commit{
      continuous_integration()
    }

    on_pull_request to: develop, {
      continuous_integration()
      deploy_to dev
      parallel "508 Testing": { accessibility_compliance_test() },
              "Functional Testing": { functional_test() },
              "Penetration Testing": { penetration_test() }
      deploy_to staging
      performance_test()
    }

    on_merge to: master, from: develop, {
      deploy_to prod
      smoke_test()
    }

**Example using regular expressions directly**

.. code:: groovy 

    on_commit to: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, {
      // will be triggered on feature branches
    }
    on_pull_request from: /^[Ff]eature-.*/, to: develop, {
      // will be triggered on PR's from feature to develop
    }

**Example using on_change**

.. code:: groovy 

    on_change{
      // do CI on every commit or PR
      continuous_integration()
    }
    on_pull_request to: master, {
      // do some stuff on PR to master
    }
    on_merge to: master, {
      // PR was merged into master
    }

External Dependencies
=====================

- The github_enterprise library and the sdp library needs to be loaded as libraries inside your pipeline_config.groovy file.
